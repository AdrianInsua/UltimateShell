# NeoVim

Use vim and be happy!

## Configuration

The configuration is modularized in 3 config files imported in init.vim

- Editor.vim: Basic vim editor configuration like tabwidth, set number..
- Plugins.vim: Usefull plugins to have a great vim editor, at least to work with typescript / javascript
- Mappings.vim: These are personal preference mappings. Feel free to change them.

## Fixes

W10 does not load [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) preview.sh so to fix that we use the deprecated preview.rb (you will need Ruby!)

## Snippets

We've added some usefull snipets to type tests faster. just check them in snippets file
